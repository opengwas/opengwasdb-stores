# Gap-scan test suite

Test suite for `curation.gap_scan` (issue #163).

## The contract this suite exists for

Trait Ontology Mapping is frozen into every Release Manifest's `analyses.tsv`.
Rows with `trait_ontology_mapping_method = unmapped` are the curation gap. The
gap scan must turn an explicit set of committed Manifests into a correct,
prioritised work queue for Canonical Trait Mapping Table curation, without
modifying a Manifest, a generator, or a bundle.

A wrong queue is silently expensive: a mis-normalised label fragments one
curation candidate into several, an under-count demotes a high-value label, and
a wrong Store Family attribution sends the review to the wrong place.

## Contracts and invariants covered

1. **Selection**: only `unmapped` rows are queued; `source_provided` and
   `canonical_table_lookup` rows are excluded.
2. **Normalisation**: labels are trimmed then lowercased, exactly the R
   resolver's `trimws(tolower(x))`; case/whitespace variants collapse and their
   occurrence counts sum.
3. **Attribution**: `store_families` is derived from a sibling `release.yaml`
   (`store_family_id`/`family`), a `releases/` or `families/` path segment, or
   the bundle directory name, and is rendered sorted and comma-separated.
4. **Ordering**: the queue is descending by `occurrence_count` with an
   alphabetical tie-break, so output is deterministic.
5. **Empty is not an error**: a Manifest with no unmapped rows, or with no
   mapping column at all, contributes nothing and the CLI exits 0.
6. **Loud failure**: a missing path, a ragged row, and a Manifest with a mapping
   column but no recognisable trait label raise; the CLI reports and exits 1.
7. **CLI surface**: manifest files and bundle directories are accepted; output
   goes to stdout or `--output`; the header is always present.
